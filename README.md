# A XOR cipher

Wanted to see some simple forms of encryption and found the xor-cipher. Here is a casual attempt at it.


## Build guide
```
git clone <this repo>
cd xor_cipher
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./xorCipher <your input string>
```

## Notes

- Made to only work with one argument.
- all inputs are treated as ASCII chars

### Open an issue if you see any improvements.
